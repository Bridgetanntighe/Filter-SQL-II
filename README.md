<h2>Task 1. Retrieve after hours failed login attempts </h2>
The team is investigating failed login attempts that were made after business hours. I will work to retrieve this information from the login activity. Iâ€™ll identify all unsuccessful attempts after 18:00. <br>

The login_time column in the <i>log_in_attempts</i> table contains information on when login attempts were made. Office hours end at '18:00'<br>
The <i>success</i> column in the <i>log_in_attempts</i> table contains values of <i>TRUE</i> or <i>FALSE</i> to indicate whether the login was successful.<br> MySQL stores Boolean values as <i>1</i> for <i>TRUE</i>, and <i>0</i> for <i>FALSE</i>. This means that <i>TRUE</i> is represented as <i>1</i>, and <i>FALSE</i> represented as <i>0</i> in the <i>success</i> column. <br>
